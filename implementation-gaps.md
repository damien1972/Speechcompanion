# Implementation Gaps Analysis

Based on the analysis of the project files, the following implementation gaps have been identified:

## 1. Session Context Integration

- **SessionContext.tsx**: The file exists but needs to be properly integrated with other components
- **Missing useSession hook**: The `useSession` hook is imported in components like VisualSessionTimer but needs to be implemented
- **Session persistence**: Need to implement the storage utilities referenced in SessionContext

## 2. Authentication System

- **AuthContext.tsx**: The file exists but needs implementation for therapist authentication
- **Login/Logout functionality**: Need to implement NextAuth.js integration
- **Protected routes**: Need to implement route protection for therapist-only areas

## 3. Core Components Implementation

- **Visual Session Timer**: Component exists but needs integration with session context
- **Behavior Momentum Builder**: Component exists but needs functionality implementation
- **Dragon's Den Reset Space**: Component needs to be created or completed
- **Token Economy Visualizer**: Component exists but needs integration with session data
- **Transition Support System**: Component exists but needs implementation
- **Therapist Control Panel**: Component exists but needs implementation

## 4. AI Integration

- **AIService.ts**: File exists but needs implementation for OpenAI API integration
- **Prompt Engineering System**: Need to implement prompt templates and management
- **Speech Recording and Analysis**: Need to implement Web Audio API integration
- **Content Generation**: Need to implement AI-assisted content generation

## 5. Data Persistence Layer

- **Storage Utilities**: Need to implement local storage and API integration
- **Offline Support**: Need to implement service worker for offline functionality
- **Data Synchronization**: Need to implement data sync between local and server

## 6. Accessibility Features

- **Cognitive Accessibility**: Test files exist but need to implement actual features
- **Simplified Visual Hierarchy**: Need to implement in UI components
- **Large Text and Touch Targets**: Need to ensure consistent implementation

## 7. Main Application Integration

- **App Shell**: Need to create or complete the main application shell
- **Navigation**: Need to implement navigation between different activities
- **Component Composition**: Need to integrate all components into a cohesive application

## 8. Testing and Validation

- **Accessibility Testing**: Need to implement automated accessibility tests
- **Functional Testing**: Need to implement component and integration tests
- **Performance Testing**: Need to implement performance optimization and testing

## Priority Implementation Order

1. Session Context Integration (useSession hook and storage utilities)
2. Authentication System (AuthContext implementation)
3. Core Components Implementation (focusing on Visual Session Timer and Therapist Controls)
4. Data Persistence Layer
5. AI Integration
6. Accessibility Features
7. Main Application Integration
8. Testing and Validation
